# IsingFriction2016

This repo includes sources codes and a makefile for a Monte Carlo simulation program of the Ising model with
- two-dimensional rectangular geometry ($ L_x * L_z $),
- heat-bath with the temperature $ T $,
- sliding plane with the velocity $ v $.

The simulation program is mainly intended to reproduce the results of Ref.<sup>[1](#Kadau)</sup> and so on, and extend the results. The simulation was also used to generate the result of my paper<sup>[2](#Sugimoto)</sup>.

TODO: Add a description about its fundamental interface and the simulation protocol.

Notice: This repo have not been maintained for a long time. Makefile especially does not work properly. But the program itself *probably* works correctly.
